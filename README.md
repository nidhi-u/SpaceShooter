# Space Shooter

Dodge asteroids, defeat foes, and dance with missiles in this cosmic space escapade!


In this 2D top-down game, the player controls a spaceship using wasd or arrow keys for movement. The player can shoot bullets by clicking the left mouse button. 

Asteroids rain from the top of the screen moving towards the bottom with varying speeds and having different sizes and consecutive damage dealt to player on collision. The player must dodge or destroy these asteroids. 

Enemy spaceships enter from the top of the screen and spawn missiles aimed at the player every few seconds until they are destroyed by the player. The missiles track the player and need to be shot down to avoid damamge. 

There is a health bar and a point counter at the top of the screen. 

Health packs move in the same way as the asteroids but are much rarer and restores some of the player's health when caught. Shooting a health pack does destroy it with no health restoration, discouraging the player from continuously shooting without aiming.
